# Onipat
Capture every image, explore everywhere. This is Onipat.

### 🌟 Why Onipat?

A lightweight, powerful, and completely free Chrome extension crafted to solve the frustration of image downloading on countless websites.

I was very frustrated when I wanted to download images from some website and they required me to log in. I searched for a tool to download all the locked photos, and surprisingly, none of the tools worked as well as I had hoped. So I programmed Onipat myself, a tool that helps you download every image from all over the internet, no matter how blocked or difficult they are.

### The Behind the Name

The name "Onipat" is not a random choice; it's a clever play on "only patch." The idea behind it is to create a single, universal patch to solve the "unable to download images" problem across all websites. Onipat was born to simplify everything, focusing on solving the core problem without any unnecessary complexity.
